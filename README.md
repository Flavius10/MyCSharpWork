# Project: IT Olympiad Solutions â€“ County and National Phase
This file contains all the solutions I have developed for the IT Olympiad, covering both the county (judeteana) and national phases. The solutions are implemented using a combination of technologies such as ASP .NET, C#, and .NET Core.

The projects include a variety of problems that I solved throughout the competition, demonstrating my ability to approach complex algorithmic challenges and implement efficient, scalable solutions. I have used ASP .NET for web-based problems, building dynamic applications with robust backend logic, as well as C# for algorithmic solutions and problem-solving tasks. For modern projects, I employed .NET Core to create cross-platform applications with optimized performance.

Key highlights of this collection include:

    Algorithmic problem-solving: Implementing efficient algorithms to solve problems within strict time and memory limits.

    Web development using ASP .NET: Developing web applications with full-stack features, including handling user inputs, form submissions, and data persistence.

    Cross-platform solutions using .NET Core: Creating versatile applications that can run on multiple platforms without modification.

    Code efficiency: Focusing on writing clean, optimized, and maintainable code.

This project showcases my skills in C# programming, problem-solving techniques, and web development, and it highlights my experience in both competitive programming and real-world application development.
